@name The Testing Coin: Introduction
@description

* We don’t want manual regression - it's costly and slow at scale
* We need automation to keep up with development
* We need complex manual testing in order to find interesting “relevant”  bugs that the automated regression checks won’t discover
* Important to retain both sides of the testing coin: manual & automation
* Always think about the economic cost in your balance
