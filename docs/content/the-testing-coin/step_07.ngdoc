# Code coverage

Mindmaps are good for understanding test coverage. Another way is via *code coverage* tools. These tools watch the code which is used when the tests are run. This exercise shows you the coverage for the todo unit tests.

^^ Setup

1. In todo directory, run this command:

    <pre>git checkout -f step-3</pre>

    This resets your workspace to step 3 of the tutorial app.

2. Start the app: `grunt server`
3. Load the app in the browser: {@link http://localhost:9999}

^^ Coverage

Now that we know that the application should be working as expected, it is time to break it!

1. Run the tests with coverage: `grunt coverage`
2. Load the test results in the browser: {@link http://localhost:9999}
3. What strategies could you now use to do exploratory testing?
