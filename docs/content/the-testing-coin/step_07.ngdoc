# Code coverage

Mindmaps are good for understanding test coverage. Another way is via *code coverage* tools. These tools watch the code which is used when the tests are run. This exercise shows you the coverage for the todo unit tests.

^^ Setup

1. In todo directory, run this command:

    <pre>git checkout -f step-3</pre>

    This resets your workspace to step 3 of the tutorial app.

2. Run the coverage

    <pre>grunt coverage</pre>

^^ Coverage

In the unit tests, we saw that the code was tested - we say that it had *coverage*. But how much was covered? Code coverage looks at all the paths of the code that were run. In our example, any code in *red* was not run.

1. Run the tests with coverage: `grunt coverage`
2. Load the test results in the browser: `coverage\<your browser>\index.html`
3. What purpose do you think coverage is good for?

<div ng-hide="show" class="">
  <a href="" ng-click="show=true;$event.stopPropagation()">Show fuller instructions with pictures  âž¤</a>
</div>
<div class="tabbable ng-hide" ng-show="show" >
  You looking to open the coverage view through a browser. The file to open changes depending on the version of the browser. Start in webstorm `coverage\<your browser>\index.html`
  <img class="screenshot small" src="img/the-testing-coin/coverage-1.png">
  Open this file: right click Open in Browser)
  <img class="screenshot small" src="img/the-testing-coin/coverage-1-2.png">
  Now study the stats. Anything less than 100% does have full coverage (this may not be bad). Click through on the `js\controllers`.
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/coverage-2.png">
  Click on the `todoCtrl`
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/coverage-3.png">
  Now you can see more detail with the red code that has been covered.
