# Acceptance tests

Acceptance tests usually give the big picture about the application - business processes or whether the application looks like it is in a working state. They don't tend to tell you much about the internal workings of the application but rather ask does the system work? The goal of this step is to run and read the acceptance tests for the todo application and compare with the previous record and replay style.

^^ Setup

1. In todo directory, run this command:

    <pre>git checkout -f step-1</pre>

    This resets your workspace to step 1 of the todo app.

2. Start the app: `grunt server-test`
3. Load the app in the browser: {@link http://localhost:9555}

^^ Acceptance

1. `grunt server-test` - this starts up the test server
2. Can you read the test results?
3. Open up source code, can you find the tests and relate them back to the results?
4. Can you understand the tests?
5. How reliable are these tests going to be?
