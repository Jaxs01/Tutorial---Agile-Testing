# Acceptance tests

Acceptance tests usually give the big picture about the application - business processes or whether the application looks like it is in a working state. They don't tend to tell you much about the internal workings of the application but rather ask does the system work? The goal of this step is to run and read the acceptance tests for the todo application and compare with the previous record and replay style.

^^ Setup

1. In todo directory, run this command:

    <pre>git checkout -f step-1</pre>

    This resets your workspace to step 1 of the todo app.

2. Start up the test server in the browser and keeps it open

    <pre>grunt watch</pre>

^^ Acceptance

2. Can you read the test results?
4. Can you understand the tests?
5. How reliable are these tests going to be?

<div ng-hide="show" class="">
  <a href="" ng-click="show=true;$event.stopPropagation()">Show fuller instructions with pictures  ➤</a>
</div>
<div class="tabbable ng-hide" ng-show="show" >
  Browser window open, the test should automatically run
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/e2e-1.png">
  Then it is blank! So click on `Debug`
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/e2e-2.png">
  Then you can run it all again, and again.

^^ Extension

3. Open up source code, can you find the tests and relate them back to the results?
4. Can you understand the tests in this form?
5. Could you change them and run them again?

<div ng-hide="show" class="">
  <a href="" ng-click="show=true;$event.stopPropagation()">Show fuller instructions with pictures  ➤</a>
</div>
<div class="tabbable ng-hide" ng-show="show" >
  Open up Webstorm to the file test/e2e/acceptance.js
  <img class="screenshot small" src="img/the-testing-coin/acceptance-1.png">
</div>
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/acceptance-2.png">
