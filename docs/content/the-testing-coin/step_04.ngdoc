# Record and Replay

You are now ready to test the Todo app. In this step, you will become familiar with using SeleniumBuilder as a way to perform record and replay tests.

|--
^^ Setup

1. In todo directory, run this command:

    <pre>git checkout -f step-0</pre>

    This resets your workspace to step 0 of the todo app.

2. Start the app

    <pre>grunt server</pre>

3. This should automatically start the app in the browser: {@link http://localhost:9999} - the browser may need refreshing

^^ (re)Play

Run the pre-recorded tests in Mozilla Firefox using Selenium WebDriver.

1. Load up Mozilla Firefox
2. Open Selenium WebDriver (you'll need this installed from {@ http://sebuilder.github.io/se-builder/}
3. Open Script or Suite > `todo\test\create-close-filter-clear.json`
4. Run > Run tests locally
5. Work out what the tests are actually testing (before looking at the cheatsheet)

<div ng-hide="show" class="">
  <a href="" ng-click="show=true;$event.stopPropagation()">Show fuller instructions with pictures  ➤</a>
</div>
<div class="tabbable ng-hide" ng-show="show" >
  Load up Mozilla Firefox
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/webdriver-1.png">
  Open Selenium WebDriver (click on the bottom-right corner lego block!)
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/webdriver-2.png">
  Open Script or Suite > todo\test\create-close-filter-clear.json
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/webdriver-3.png">
  <img class="screenshot small" src="img/the-testing-coin/webdriver-4.png">
  Now that you have the test, let's run it! Run > Run tests locally
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/webdriver-5.png">
  <img class="screenshot small" src="img/the-testing-coin/webdriver-6.png">
  You should see the tests passing. Fingers crossed.

^^ Cheatsheet

Here is what the previous tests are doing:

<pre>
    Start Firefox (like a boss)

    (When you follow these steps, make sure page content is loaded before clicking, etc... Since you're a human, this is probably what you do already)

    - Navigate to http://todo.assurity-co.cloudbees.net/
    - Type "a new list" in "new-todo", replacing any text that was already there
    - Submit the form containing the element on the page with the id of "new-todo"
    - Make sure "All" is on the page
    - Make sure "Active" is on the page
    - Make sure "Completed" is on the page
    - Make sure "Clear completed" is not on the page
    - Make sure "1 item left" is on the page
    - Select the element(s) on the page identified by the xpath query "//div[@class='view']/input"
    - Make sure "0 items left" is on the page
    - Make sure "Clear completed" is on the page
    - Click the link which says "All"
    - Make sure "a new list" is on the page
    - Click the link which says "Completed"
    - Make sure "a new list" is on the page
    - Click the link which says "Active"
    - Make sure "a new list" is not on the page
    - Click the element on the page with the id of "clear-completed"
    - Make sure "Clear completed" is not on the page
    - Make sure "0 items left" is not on the page
    - Make sure "All" is not on the page
    - Make sure "Active" is not on the page
    - Make sure "Completed" is not on the page
    - Make sure "Clear completed" is not on the page

    You're done! Sweet.
 </pre>

*Note:* selenium builder actually exports this text from the script. Give it a try:

1. File > Export > English

<div ng-hide="show" class="">
  <a href="" ng-click="show=true;$event.stopPropagation()">Show fuller instructions with pictures  ➤</a>
</div>
<div class="tabbable ng-hide" ng-show="show" >
  Start with the test showing
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/seleniumbuilder-export-1.png">
  File > Export
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/seleniumbuilder-export-2.png">
  English (bottom of the list)
  <img class="screenshot" src="img/the-testing-coin/seleniumbuilder-export-3.png">
  Save file into location, say `todo\test\create-close-filter-clear.en.txt`
  <img class="screenshot small" src="img/the-testing-coin/seleniumbuilder-export-4.png">
  Now you can open the text to see what is above. Not bad!
</div>


^^  Extension

1. Just record the same test, how easy is it? Did you have problems?
2. Extend the test suite with a new test case
3. Refactor the tests into a well organised suite
