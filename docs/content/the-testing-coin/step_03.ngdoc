@name Tutorial: 3 - Running the code
@description

You are now ready to build the Todo app. In this step, you will become familiar
with the most important source code files, learn how to start the development servers bundled with
the application, and run the application in the browser.

^^ Git on Mac/Linux/Windows

1.  Clone the todo-tutorial repository located at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/Assurity/todo-tutorial/) by running the following command:

    <pre>git clone https://bitbucket.org/Assurity/todo-tutorial.git</pre>

    This command creates the `todo-tutorial` directory in your current directory
2.  Change your current directory to `todo-tutorial`:

    <pre>cd todo-tutorial</pre>

    The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from the todo-tutorial directory.

3.  In `todo-tutorial` directory, run this command (note if you are returning to this step you may have to `git checkout -f master`):

    <pre>npm install -d</pre>

    This ensures that everything will be installed in your workspace for the rest of the tutorial app.

4.  To see the app running in a browser, do one of the following:

    In a _separate_ terminal tab or window, run below which will start a server and open a browser window at to [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999). You may need to press refresh because the browser opens as the server is starting and the server may not have quite got there yet!
        <pre>grunt server</pre>

You should now see the [TODO](http://localhost:9999) app in your browser (and it would be good if you ensure you are in Mozilla Firefox). It's not very exciting, but that's OK.
