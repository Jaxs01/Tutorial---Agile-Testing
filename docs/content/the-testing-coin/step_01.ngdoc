@name Tutorial: 1 - Running the code
@description

Lets load up the Todo app for this section. Once we have the Todo app running we can use
it to compare different types of testing including looking at automation.

^^ Tutorial Source

1.  You already have the `todo-tutorial` directory in your `tutorial` directory
2.  Change your current directory to `todo-tutorial`:

    <pre>cd tutorial/todo-tutorial</pre>

    The tutorial instructions assume you are running all commands from the todo-tutorial directory.

3.  In `todo-tutorial` directory, run this command (note if you are returning to this step you may have to `git checkout -f master`):

    <pre>npm install -d</pre>

    This ensures that everything will be installed in your workspace for the rest of the tutorial app.

4.  To see the app running in a browser, do one of the following:

    In a _separate_ terminal tab or window, run below which will start a server and open a browser window at to [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999). You may need to press refresh because the browser opens as the server is starting and the server may not have quite got there yet!
        <pre>grunt server</pre>

You should now see the [TODO](http://localhost:9999) app in your browser. It's is pretty simple, but that's OK.

^^ Avoiding command line

You may not want to work in the `terminal` window (command line). If you don't want to you'll first need to setup Webstorm. It has two steps:

1. Setup configurations

2. Change branches
