# Summary - The Testing Coin

* both sides: manual and automation
* the coin is the whole-team approach
* you are trying to create time for as much exploratory testing as possible
* make sure the base of e2e/acceptance and unit tests is the right shape
* avoid manual regression tests
* build as small a GUI set of tests as possible to retain confidence
* hard to do without a solid base of automation because you end of doing manual regression testing instead
