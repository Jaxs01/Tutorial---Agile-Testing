# Summary - The Testing Coin

Exploratory testing requires you to use quite sophisticated heuristics. Exploring reveals unintended consequences and uncovers implicit expectations

* How did testing change in the second approach? (collaborative, immediate, preventing instead of finding, questions are important and encouraged)
* How many bugs did you find? Did it matter? When were bugs being identified?
* Which brochure was higher quality, in your opinion? How did the different approach change the outcomes for the client?
* Can you see why automated testing is considered important in an agile context? Potential for regression / limited testing timeframes.
