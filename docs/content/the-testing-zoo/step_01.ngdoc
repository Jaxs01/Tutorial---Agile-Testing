^^ Exercise

<img class="diagram" src="img/the-testing-zoo/wgtn_zoo.jpg"/>

^^ Your mission

* 5 minutes
* Verify that the requirements from the Wellington Zoo Marketing Manager have been met.
* Count how many bugs you find

<countdown time="300"/>

--> Speaker's Notes: To illustrate the differences between testing in a waterfall environment and an agile environment, we're going to get you to complete an exercise in each and draw your own comparisons. We'll start with the familiar. You'll have 5 minutes (it would have been 10, but development missed their deadline) to verify that the requirements from the Wellington Zoo Marketing Manager for their new brochure have been met. Your test exit report is very simple; how many bugs did you find. Hand out materials, have a visible countdown clock running (iPad or laptop)

^^ Status Report

* How many bugs did you find?
* Were you happy with your testing?
* What could have made your testing better?

--> Speaker's Notes: Go around and ask for bug counts. (I would write these on a whiteboard in the room and leave them for discussion later in the session)

^^ Feedback

* How do you feel about this?

--> Speaker's Notes: The Wellington Zoo Marketing Manager receives her brochure. Her feedback is... Great work on those bugs, but...; That's too much writing; more pictures would be great; It won't fold in to a brochure properly?; We don't have an elephant!
