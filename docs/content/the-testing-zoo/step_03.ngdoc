  * Teams of 3 people; 2 developers & 1 tester
  * 5 minute sprints
  * Prioritised backlog to work through
  * Facilitator(s) act as the customer

--> Speaker's Notes: In agile the team work together to deliver a product. We'll work in teams of three, 2 developers and 1 tester. The testers cannot use scissors and felts, they don't have those skills, but otherwise everyone is working together. You can have a minute to work out who will be doing what...

    Hand out the initial scrum board to each group, with all 9 stories blu-tacked in order down the left hand column, scissors, paper, felts, and page of useful images.
